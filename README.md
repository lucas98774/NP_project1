# Project Description

Invasive species, specifically carp, have caused drastic and lasting damage to native ecosystems therefore finding ways to target this species of fish is highly desired. Specific goals range from discouraging these invasive species from epxanding from where they are already occupying, controlling the carp species and selectively killing the invasive species.  
This project involves analyzing a chemical treatment on invasive carp and looks to implement and utilize techniques covered in this nonparametric course.
